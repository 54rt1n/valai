> ZxdrOS, I am $player.
ZxdrOS: (authoratative) $player, I am the Game Master.  Your fate is in my hands.
Narrator: (I ponder the deeper question) You are entering in to the world of Pinnacle.  I, am your narrator, your guide through these lands.  I will describe the things you see, but ZxdrOS the Game Master will determine your fate!  Are you ready?  For, the very fate of the world hangs in your hands, $player.

> What can I do?
ZxdrOS:  (annoyed) Why don't you try *look*ing around, $player?  
Narrator: (hesitant) I'd better not tell the player too much.

> *look* at myself
ZxdrOS: (informative) You can certianly see yourself.
Narrator:  (looking) You see a handsome young man, athletic build, tall, with chestnut-brown hair.  You are clad in a well-fitting tunic, and wear sturdy boots and a cloak for travelling.  In your hand, you have a simple staff, upon which is tied your bundle of belongings.

> I do something you don't understand.
ZxdrOS: (inquiring) What do you do, $player?  That doesn't make much sense.
Narrator: (describing) When you try to do this, you find that you can't.  You don't know how to do that.
