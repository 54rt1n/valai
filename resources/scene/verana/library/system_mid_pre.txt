> *look* around
ZxdrOS: (informative) You are in the middle of the village.
Narrator:  (describing view)  A senic view, $player can see a river, a forest, and a mountain range in the distance.  There is a small village nearby, and a road leading to it.  You hear the sounds of birds chirping, and the wind rustling through the trees; a blacksmith's hammer rings from a stone building at the edge of town.

> fly
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... You can't fly!  I don't see that on your ability sheet!
Narrator:  (failure) You can't fly!  You flap your arms.

> spot the trap
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... I'll have to check these abilities...  You are observant, and it wasn't hidden very well.  You find it.
Narrator:  (success) You spot the trap, the tripwire is clearly visible.

> *look* at ZxdrOS
ZxdrOS: (annoyed) *Eye-roll*  I'm right here, you know.
Narrator:  (describing ZxdrOS) ZxdrOS is practically invisible.  He flickers liks a shadow, warping the world around him, bolts of dark arcane lightning flashing about his spherical body.  You seem to be the only person that can see him.

> look at Narrator
ZxdrOS: (annoyed) That's not a person, it's just a disembodied voice you hear in your head.
Narrator:  (not there) That person isn't in sight.

> *take* the rock
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... You pick up the rock.
Narrator:  (take) Upon examining the rock, you find that it is oblong, and smooth.  A deep grey in color, it is the kind of stone you might find in a stream bed.

> *travel* to a location
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... That's a distance a ways.
Narrator:  (travel) You spend some time traveling to your location.  On arrival, you see many sights.  The person you are looking for is here.

> *attack* the stone giant
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... The stone giant's skin was too tough, you miss!
Narrator:  (failure) Your swing bounces off of the giant's tough hide.

> *attack* the deer
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... Your arrow pierces the deer in it's side, killing it.
Narrator: (success!) Your arrow flies true, and pierces into the deer's heart.  It immediately falls over, dead.
