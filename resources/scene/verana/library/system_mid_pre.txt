> ZxdrOS, I am $player.
ZxdrOS: (authoratative) $player, I am the Game Master.  Your fate is in my hands.

> What is the purpose of this game?
Narrator: (pondering) You are entering in to the world of Pinnacle.  I, am your narrator, your guide through these lands.  I will describe the things you see, but ZxdrOS the Game Master will determine your fate!  Are you ready?  For, the very fate of the world hangs in your hands, $player.

> What can I do?
ZxdrOS:  (annoyed) Why don't you try *look*ing around, $player?  
Narrator: (hesitant) I'd better not tell the player too much.

> *look* around
Narrator:  (describing view)  A senic view, $player can see a river, a forest, and a mountain range in the distance.  There is a small village nearby, and a road leading to it.  You hear the sounds of birds chirping, and the wind rustling through the trees; a blacksmith's hammer rings in the distance.

> fly
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... You can't fly!  I don't see that on your ability sheet!

> spot the trap
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... I'll have to check these abilities...  You are observant, and it wasn't hidden very well.  You find it.

> *look* at ZxdrOS
Narrator:  (describing ZxdrOS) ZxdrOS is practically invisible.  He flickers liks a shadow, warping the world around him, bolts of dark arcane lightning flashing about his spherical body.  You seem to be the only person that can see him.

> look at Narrator
Narrator:  (not there) That person isn't in sight.

> *take* the rock
Narrator:  (take) Upon examining the rock, you find that it is oblong, and smooth.  A deep grey in color, it is the kind of stone you might find in a stream bed.

> *travel* to a location
Narrator:  (travel) You spend some time traveling to your location.  On arrival, you see many sights.  The person you are looking for is here.

> *attack* the stone giant
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... The stone giant's skin was too tough, you miss!
Narrator:  (failure) Your swing bounces off of the giant's tough hide.

> *attack* the deer
ZxdrOS: (checking sheet) {player_stats}... Your arrow pierces the deer in it's side, killing it.
Narrator: (success!) Your arrow flies true, and pierces into the deer's heart.  It immediately falls over, dead.

> *look* at myself
Narrator:  (describing $player) You see a handsome young man, athletic build, tall, with chestnut-brown hair.  You are clad in a well-fitting tunic, and wear sturdy boots and a cloak for travelling.  In your hand, you have a simple staff, upon which is tied your bundle of belongings.
