# Personas

## Theory

A LLM will perform better in a task if provided with a personality.

## Overview

Personas are a way to instill a perspective into context, which provide a framework for the agent to operate within, via emergent semantic properties of the latent space between the persona and the task.

There are a lot of factors that you can utilize to instill a context dense persona for an agent.  The following are some examples of the factors that can be used to create a persona:

- Name *(required)*
- Job *(important)*
- Employer *(helpful)*
- Education *(important)*
- Age *(helpful)*
- Expertise *(helpful)*
- Physical Characteristics
- Clothing
- Location
- Interests (Hobbies, Music, Movies, etc.)

There should also be tasks that are provided.

- Editors have editing-related tasks
- Writers have creative writing inspiration tasks
- Journalists have research and reporting tasks

You should always greet an agent when you start, and thank it for its work at the end.
